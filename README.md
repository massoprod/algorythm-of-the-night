## Algorithms

### Factorial
> The factorial function (symbol: !) says to multiply all whole numbers from our chosen number down to 1.
#### Example
`5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`

#### Basic
```java
public static long factorial(int x) {
    long fact = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= x; i++) {
        fact = fact * i;
    }
    return fact;
}
```
#### Recursion
```java
public static long factorial(int x) {
    if (x == 0) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return x * factorial(x - 1);
    }
}
```

### Fibonacci
> The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers in which each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. It's first two terms are 0 and 1.
#### Example
> The first 11 terms of the series are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and 55.

`S(n) = S(n-1) + S(n-2), with S(0) = 0 and S(1) = 1`

#### Recursion
```java
public static long fibonacci(int x) {
    if (x < 2) {
        return x;
    } else {
        return fibonacci(x-1) + fibonacci(x-2);
    }
}
```

### Includes
> Check if array of length *n* includes number *x*

> *left* and *right* are field boundaries

#### Recursion
```java
public static void includes(int [] array, int x, int left, int right) {
    if (left > right) {
        System.out.println("Not Includes");
    }

    if (array[left] == x) {
        System.out.println("Includes");
    } else {
        includes(array, x, left+1, right);
    }
}
```

### Zero sum subsequence
> If we have sequence of numbers 2 8 -9 1, there is a zero sum subsequence because it contains 8 -9 1, whose sum is 8 -9 + 1 = 0. If sequence were 1 2 -9 8, results should be falsy because numbers whose sum is zero are not next to each other.

> Given an array of positive and negative numbers, find if there is a subarray (of size at-least one) with 0 sum.

#### Example
Example with reading numbers from file and write returned values to output file:
[NodeJS example with file reading from file and writing results to output file](https://github.com/massoprod/zero-sum-subsequence-nodejs)

#### Solution
```java
public static boolean isZeroSumSubsequenceInArray(int array[]) {
    int sum = 0;
    Set<Integer> hs = new HashSet<Integer>();

    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        sum += array[i];
        if (sum == 0 || hs.contains(sum) || array[i] == 0) {
            return true;
        }

        hs.add(sum);
    }

    return false;
}
```

### Greatest common divisor
> The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers. For two integers *x*, *y*, the greatest common divisor of x and y is denoted *GCD(x,y)*.

#### Recursion
```java
public static int getGCD(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        return a;
    } else {
        return getGCD(b, a % b);
    }
}
```

### Palindrome
> A palindrome is a word, phrase, number or sequence of words that reads the same backward as forward. Punctuation and spaces between the words or lettering is allowed.

#### Example
***Is not palindrome:*** *hello, world, 123,...*

***Is palindrome:*** *lol, madam, abba, 1221,...*

#### Solutions
```java
public static boolean isPalindrome(String text) {
    int i = 0;
    int j = text.length() - 1;

    while (i < j) {
        if (text.charAt(i) != text.charAt(j)) {
            return false;
        }

        i++;
        j--;
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Quadratic equation
> A quadratic equation is an equation that could be written as: `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`

> The solution(s) to a quadratic equation can be calculated using the Quadratic Formula: `x = (-b +- sqrt(b^2-4ac)) / 2a`

> The *Â±* means we need to do a plus an a minus, so there are normally two solutions

> Discriminant: `D = b2 - 4ac` -> it can "discriminate" between the possible types of answer

> D is positive, we get two real solutions

> D is zero we get just one solution

> D is negative we get complex solutions

#### Solutions
```java
public static void getQuadraticEquationRoots(double a, double b, double c) {
    double x1, x2;
    double d =  (b * b) - (4 * a * c);

    if (d > 0) {
        x1 = (-b + Math.sqrt(d)) / (2 * a);
        x2 = (-b - Math.sqrt(d)) / (2 * a);

        System.out.println("X1: " + x1);
        System.out.println("X2: " + x2);
    } else if (d == 0) {
        double root = -b / (2 * a);

        System.out.println("X1,2: " + root);
    } else {
        double realPart = -b / (2 *a);
        double imaginaryPart = Math.sqrt(-d) / (2 * a);

        System.out.format("X1 = %.2f+%.2fi\nX2 = %.2f-%.2fi", realPart, imaginaryPart, realPart, imaginaryPart);
    }
}
```
